<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

By the standards of modern astrometry, the earth is quite a wobbly
platform from which to observe the sky.  The earth's rotation rate is not
uniform, its axis of rotation is not fixed in space, and even its shape
and relative positions of its surface locations are not fixed.  For the
purposes of pointing a telescope to one-arcsecond accuracy, we need not
worry about shape and surface feature changes, but changes in the
orientation of the earth's rotation axis are very important.

<p>In a sense, equatorial sky coordinates are a compromise between an
earth-based system and one fixed with respect to distant stars.  Right
ascension and declination are quite analogous to longitude and latitude on
the earth's surface.  They share the same polar axis and equator, but the
sky coordinate grid does not rotate with the earth's daily spin.  However,
apparent right ascension and declination are not fixed with respect to the
stars because their coordinate frame follows the motion the earth's pole
and equator.  To be able to list star positions in catalogs, we have
agreed to use the position of the earth's pole and equator at specified
times, essentially snapshots of the RA and Dec coordinates at those times.
January 1, 1950 and 2000 are the most common coordinate epochs.

</p><p>The zero point of right ascension is not assigned to a particular
celestial object in the same way that zero longitude is defined to be at
Greenwich, England.  Zero right ascension is the point where the sun
appears to cross the celestial equator on its south to north journey
through the sky in the spring.  In three dimensions, the vernal equinox is
the direction of the line where the plane of the earth's equator
intersects the plane of the earth's orbit.  Since the earth's orientation
is constantly changing with respect to the stars, so does the position of
the vernal equinox.

</p><p>In practice, celestial coordinates are tied to observed objects because
the location of the vernal equinox is hard to measure directly.  The B1950
coodinate grid location is defined by the publish positions of stars in
the fourth Fundamental-Katalog, FK4, and the J2000 system is based on FK5.
These catalogs list mostly nearby stars so any definition of coordinates
tied to these catalogs is subject to errors due to motions of the stars on
the sky.  The FK4 equinox is now known to drift with respect to the FK5
equinox by about 0.085 arcseconds per century, quite a bit by VLBI
standards.

</p><p>Currently, the most stable definition of J2000 coordinates is one
based on about 400 extragalactic objects in
the <a href="http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/">Radio Optical Reference
Frame</a>.  This is heavily biased toward VLBI radio sources, but it
will soon be tied to many more optical objects by the HIPPARCOS
satellite.  The RORF is stable to at least 0.020 arcseconds per
century, and this is improving with better observations and a longer
time base.  The positional accuracy of the ensemble of 400 objects is
about 0.0005 arcseconds.

</p><p>For partly historical and partly practical reasons, the time variablity
of the direction of the earth's rotation axis and an observatory's
relation to it are divided into four components: precession, nutation,
celestial pole offset, and polar motion.  By definition, precession and
nutation are mathematically defined through the adoption of the best
available equations.  Celestial pole offset and polar motion
are observed offsets from the mathematical formulae and are not
predictable over long periods of time.  All four components are described
in more detail below.

</p><h2><a name="prec">Precession</a></h2>

Neither the plane of the earth's orbit, the ecliptic, nor the plane of the
earth's equator are fixed with respect to distant objects <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref1">[ref 1]</a>.  The dominant motion is the precession of the
earth's polar axis around the ecliptic pole, mainly due torques on the
earth cause by the moon and sun.  The earth's axis sweeps out a cone of
23.5 degrees half angle in 26,000 years.

<p>The ecliptic pole moves more slowly.  If we imagine the motion of the
two poles with respect to very distant objects, the earth's pole is moving
about 20 arcseconds per year, and the ecliptic pole is moving about 0.5
arcseconds per year.  The combined motion and its effect on the position
of the vernal equinox are called general precession.  The predictable
short term deviations of the earth's axis from its long term precession
are called nutation as explained in the next section.

</p><p>Equations, accurate to one arcsecond, for computing precession
corrections to right ascension and declination for a given date within
about 20 years of the year 2000 are

</p><pre>	RA = RA(2000) + (3.075 + 1.336 * sin(RA) * tan(Dec)) * y
	Dec = Dec(2000) + 20.04 * cos(RA) * y
</pre>

where <tt>y</tt> is the time from January 1, 2000 in fractional years, and
the offsets in RA and Dec are in seconds of time and arcseconds,
respectively.  Very accurate telescope pointing calculations should use
the exact equations given on pages 104 and 105 of <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref1">ref
[1]</a>.

<h2><a name="nut">Nutation</a></h2>

Predictable motions of the earth's rotation axis on time scales less than
300 years are combined under nutation.  This can be thought of as a first
order correction to precession.  The currently standard nutation theory is
composed of 106 non-harmonically-related sine and cosine components,
mainly due to second-order torque effects from the sun and moon, plus 85
planetary correction terms.  The four dominant periods of nutation are
18.6 years (precession period of the lunar orbit), 182.6 days (half a
year), 13.7 days (half a month), and 9.3 years (rotation period of the
moon's perigee).

<p>Normally, the corrections for precession and nutation in right ascension and
declination will be handled by the telescope control computer.  But, if
you are stuck in the wilderness with a hand held calculator, or you want to
check a position, the following approximation for nutation are good to
about an arcsecond <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref2">[ref 2]</a>.

</p><pre>	delta RA = (0.9175 + 0.3978 * sin(RA) * tan(Dec)) * dL
						 - cos(RA) * tan(Dec) * dE
	delta Dec = 0.3978 * cos(RA) * dL + sin(RA) * dE
</pre>

where delta RA and delta Dec are added to mean coordinates to get apparent
coordinates, and the nutations in longitude, dL, and obliquity of the
ecliptic, dE, may be found in the Astronomical Almanac, pages B24-B31, or
computed from the two largest terms in the general theory with

<pre>	dL = -17.3 * sin(125.0 - 0.05295 * d)
					- 1.4 * sin(200.0 + 1.97129 * d)
	dE = 9.4 * cos(125.0 - 0.05295 * d)
					+ 0.7 * cos(200.0 + 1.97129 * d)
</pre>

where d = Julian Date - 2451545.0, the sine and cosine arguments are in
degrees, and dL and dE are in arcseconds.

<h2><a name="cpo">Celestial Pole Offset</a></h2>

The celestial pole offset is the unpredictable part of nutation.  These
offsets are published in <a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat">IERS Bulletin A</a> as
offsets in dL and dE.  For telescope pointing they are not important since
they are on the order of 0.03 arcseconds.

<h2><a name="polar_motion">Polar Motion</a></h2>

Because of internal motions and shape deformations of the earth, an axis
defined by the locations of a set of observatories on the surface of the
earth is not fixed with respect to the rotation axis which defines the
celestial pole.  The movement of one axis with respect to the other is
called polar motion.  For a particular observatory, it has the effect of
changing the observatory's effective latitude as used in the
transformation from terrestrial to celestial coordinates.  The
International Earth Rotation Service definition of the terrestrial
reference frame axis is called the <a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/iersexp.sup">IERS Reference Pole
(IRP)</a> as defined by it's observatory ensemble.

<p>The dominant component of polar motion, called Chandler wobble, is a
roughly circular motion of the IRP around the celestial pole with an
amplitude of about 0.7 arcseconds and a period of roughly 14 months.
Shorter and longer time scale irregularities, due to internal motions of
the earth, are not predictable and must be monitored by observation.  The
sum of Chandler wobble and irregular components of polar motion are
published weekly in <a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat">IERS Bulletin A</a> along
with predictions for a number of months into the future.

</p><h2><a name="obs_coord">Observing Station Coordinates</a></h2>

There is quite a variety of local and globle coordinate systems that may
be used to describe locations on the surface of the earth.  The three of
most importance in astronomy, geocentric, geodetic, and astronomical, are
briefly described here.  See Chapter 4 of the Explanatory Supplement to
the Astronomical Almanac <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref3">[ref 3]</a> for a more complete
discussion of terrestrial coordinates.

<h3><a name="geocentric">Geocentric</a></h3>

Geocentric coordinates are most useful for VLBI and pulsar timing where
the observer's three-dimensional location in space is important.  The
reference planes are the equator, the Greenwich Meridian, and the plane
through the earth's axis and perpendicular to the Greenwich Meridian, call
it the east-west plane.  A telescope's rectangular cordinate components
(x,y,z) are

<pre>	x = distance from the east-west plane, Greewich being positive x
	y = eastward distance from the Greenwich Merdian
	z = northward distance from the equator
</pre>

For example, the coordinates for the 140-ft telescope from VLBI are

<pre>	x =   882880.0208 meters
	y = -4924482.4385 meters
	z =  3944130.6438 meters
</pre>

Geocentric latitude and longitude are not commonly used, but they are
defined by

<pre>	latitude  = arctan( z / sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ) )
	longitude = arctan( y / x )
</pre>

<h3><a name="geodetic">Geodetic</a></h3>

The closest simple approximation to the shape of the surface of the earth
is an ellipse rotated around the earth's axis, an ellipsoid.  The
difference between the long and short axes of this ellipse is about 0.3%.
The value of flattening <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref4">[ref 4]</a>, adopted by the IERS
in 1989 is <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref5">[ref 5]</a>

<pre>	f = ( a - b ) / a = 1.0 / 298.257
</pre>

where <tt>a</tt> is the equatorial axis, and <tt>b</tt> is the polar axis
of the ellipsoid.

<p>Geodetic coordinates are a measure of the direction of the line
perpendicular to the ideal ellipsoid at the observer's location on the
earth.  Geodetic longitude is the same as geocentric longitude because they
share the same reference meridian and axis.  Geodetic and geocentric
latitude can differ by as much as 10 arcminutes at mid latitudes.  The
ellipsoid is mathematical concept so you cannot measure from it directly,
but it differs from mean sea level, also called the geoid, by less than
100 meters and more typically by less than 20 or 30 meters <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref7">[ref 7]</a>.

</p><p>Observatory longitude and latitude given in Section J of the
Astronomical Almanac can be considered geodetic to the accuracy of the
significant figures listed.  Observatory elevation are listed above mean
sea level.  Until 1984 the Almanac gave the height displacement between
the reference ellipsoid and mean sea level for a number observatories.
This has been discontinued, and the definition of the reference ellipsoid
has been refined in the meantime.

</p><p>If geocentric coordinates for an observatory are not available directly
they may be derived from geodetic coordinates using the equations given in
<a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/earth_rot.html#ref6">ref [6]</a>.

</p><h3><a name="astron">Astronomical or Geographic</a></h3>

The observatory coordinates that can be measured with only local information
are astronomical or geographic longitude and latitude.  They are
defined by the local gravity vector and the direction of the celestial
pole.  Since the gravity vector is influenced by the local distribution of
mass and density near the observatory, the difference between astronomical
and geodetic coordinates can be as much as an arcminute.

<p>For the purpose of pointing a telescope, astronomical coordinates are
often sufficient.  The conversion from altitude and azimuth to
celestial coordinates can be made perfectly accurately using astronomical
longitude and latitude and the sidereal time consistent with this
longitude.

</p><p>However, pointing corrections to most telescopes are on the order of
minutes of arc and are determined from observations of celestial objects.
Hence, there is no particular advantage to using astronomical coordinates.
The local vertical and any known corrections are good starting points for
determining telescope pointing.  Once an altitude/azimuth coordinate
system is defined on the basis of celestial measurements, it can be
defined to be consistent with coordinates as defined in three dimensions
by VLBI or some other technique.
